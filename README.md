# **Stock Market Analysis and Prediction**

## **Overview**

The stock market is a dynamic and complex environment where investors face significant challenges, including identifying profitable opportunities, managing risks, and optimizing portfolio allocation. This project focuses on the analysis of stock data from four leading technology companies: **Apple (AAPL)**, **Microsoft (MSFT)**, **Google (GOOGL)**, and **Amazon (AMZN)**. These companies were selected for their market leadership, innovation, and global influence.

The goal of the project is to uncover valuable insights from historical stock data, leverage machine learning models to predict future stock prices, and evaluate investment strategies through portfolio optimization and backtesting. By integrating data analytics and advanced financial modeling techniques, this project aims to support better decision-making in the fast-paced stock market.
